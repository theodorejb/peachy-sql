# PeachySQL

PeachySQL is a high-performance query builder and runner which streamlines prepared statements
and working with large datasets. It is officially tested with MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server,
but it should also work with any standards-compliant database which has a driver for PDO.

## Install via Composer

`composer require devtheorem/peachy-sql`

## Usage

Start by instantiating the `PeachySql` class with a database connection,
which should be an existing [PDO object](https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.pdo.php):

```php
use DevTheorem\PeachySQL\PeachySql;

$connection = new PDO('sqlsrv:server=(local)', $username, $password, [
    PDO::ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARES => false,
    PDO::SQLSRV_ATTR_FETCHES_NUMERIC_TYPE => true,
    'Database' => 'someDbName',
]);

$db = new PeachySql($connection);
```

After instantiation, arbitrary statements can be prepared by passing a
SQL string and array of bound parameters to the `prepare()` method:

```php
$sql = "UPDATE Users SET fname = ? WHERE user_id = ?";
$stmt = $db->prepare($sql, [&$fname, &$id]);

$nameUpdates = [
    3 => 'Theodore',
    7 => 'Luke',
];

foreach ($nameUpdates as $id => $fname) {
    $stmt->execute();
}

$stmt->close();
```

Most of the time prepared statements only need to be executed a single time.
To make this easier, PeachySQL provides a `query()` method which automatically
prepares, executes, and closes a statement after results are retrieved:

```php
$sql = 'SELECT * FROM Users WHERE fname LIKE ? AND lname LIKE ?';
$result = $db->query($sql, ['theo%', 'b%']);
echo json_encode($result->getAll());
```

Both `prepare()` and `query()` return a `Statement` object with the following methods:

| Method          | Behavior                                                                                                         |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `execute()`     | Executes the prepared statement (automatically called when using `query()`).                                     |
| `getIterator()` | Returns a `Generator` object which can be used to iterate over large result sets without caching them in memory. |
| `getAll()`      | Returns all selected rows as an array of associative arrays.                                                     |
| `getFirst()`    | Returns the first selected row as an associative array (or `null` if no rows were selected).                     |
| `getAffected()` | Returns the number of rows affected by the query.                                                                |
| `close()`       | Closes the prepared statement and frees its resources (automatically called when using `query()`).               |

Internally, `getAll()` and `getFirst()` are implemented using `getIterator()`.
As such they can only be called once for a given statement.

### Shorthand methods

PeachySQL comes with five shorthand methods for selecting, inserting, updating,
and deleting records.

> [!NOTE]
> To prevent SQL injection, the queries PeachySQL generates for these methods
> always use bound parameters for values, and column names are automatically escaped.

#### select / selectFrom

The `selectFrom()` method takes a single string argument containing a SQL SELECT query.
It returns an object with three chainable methods:

1. `where()`
2. `orderBy()`
3. `offset()`

Additionally, the object has a `getSqlParams()` method which builds the select query,
and a `query()` method which executes the query and returns a `Statement` object.

```php
// select all columns and rows in a table, ordered by last name and then first name
$rows = $db->selectFrom("SELECT * FROM Users")
    ->orderBy(['lname', 'fname'])
    ->query()->getAll();

// select from multiple tables with conditions and pagination
$rows = $db->selectFrom("SELECT * FROM Users u INNER JOIN Customers c ON c.CustomerID = u.CustomerID")
    ->where(['c.CustomerName' => 'Amazing Customer'])
    ->orderBy(['u.fname' => 'desc', 'u.lname' => 'asc'])
    ->offset(0, 50) // page 1 with 50 rows per page
    ->query()->getIterator();
```

The `select()` method works the same as `selectFrom()`, but takes a `SqlParams`
object rather than a string and supports bound params in the select query:

```php
use DevTheorem\PeachySQL\QueryBuilder\SqlParams;

$sql = "
    WITH UserVisits AS
    (
        SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) AS recent_visits
        FROM UserHistory
        WHERE date > ?
        GROUP BY user_id
    )
    SELECT u.fname, u.lname, uv.recent_visits
    FROM Users u
    INNER JOIN UserVisits uv ON uv.user_id = u.user_id";

$date = (new DateTime('2 months ago'))->format('Y-m-d');

$rows = $db->select(new SqlParams($sql, [$date]))
    ->where(['u.status' => 'verified'])
    ->query()->getIterator();
```

##### Where clause generation

In addition to passing basic column => value arrays to the `where()` method, you can
specify more complex conditions by using arrays as values. For example, passing
`['col' => ['lt' => 15, 'gt' => 5]]` would generate the condition `WHERE col < 15 AND col > 5`.

Full list of recognized operators:

| Operator | SQL condition |
|----------|---------------|
| eq       | =             |
| ne       | <>            |
| lt       | <             |
| le       | <=            |
| gt       | >             |
| ge       | >=            |
| lk       | LIKE          |
| nl       | NOT LIKE      |
| nu       | IS NULL       |
| nn       | IS NOT NULL   |

If a list of values is passed with the `eq` or `ne` operator, it will generate an
IN(...) or NOT IN(...) condition, respectively. Passing a list with the `lk`, `nl`,
`nu`, or `nn` operator will generate an AND condition for each value. The `lt`, `le`,
`gt`, and `ge` operators cannot be used with a list of values.

#### insertRow

The `insertRow()` method allows a single row to be inserted from an associative array.
It returns an `InsertResult` object with readonly `id` and `affected` properties.

```php
$userData = [
    'fname' => 'Donald',
    'lname' => 'Chamberlin'
];

$id = $db->insertRow('Users', $userData)->id;
```

#### insertRows

The `insertRows()` method makes it possible to bulk-insert multiple rows from an array.
It returns a `BulkInsertResult` object with readonly `ids`, `affected`, and `queryCount` properties.

```php
$userData = [
    [
        'fname' => 'Grace',
        'lname' => 'Hopper'
    ],
    [
        'fname' => 'Douglas',
        'lname' => 'Engelbart'
    ],
    [
        'fname' => 'Margaret',
        'lname' => 'Hamilton'
    ]
];

$result = $db->insertRows('Users', $userData);
$ids = $result->ids; // e.g. [64, 65, 66]
$affected = $result->affected; // 3
$queries = $result->queryCount; // 1
```

An optional third parameter can be passed to `insertRows()` to override the default
identity increment value:

```php
$result = $db->insertRows('Users', $userData, 2);
$ids = $result->ids; // e.g. [64, 66, 68]
```

> [!NOTE]
> SQL Server allows a maximum of 1,000 rows to be inserted at a time, and limits individual queries
> to 2,099 or fewer bound parameters. MySQL and PostgreSQL support a maximum of 65,535 bound
> parameters per query. These limits can be easily reached when attempting to bulk-insert hundreds
> or thousands of rows at a time. To avoid these limits, the `insertRows()` method automatically
> splits row sets that exceed the limits into chunks to efficiently insert any number of rows
> (`queryCount` contains the number of required queries).

#### updateRows and deleteFrom

The `updateRows()` method takes three arguments: a table name, an associative array of
columns/values to update, and a WHERE array to filter which rows are updated.

The `deleteFrom()` method takes a table name and a WHERE array to filter the rows to delete.

Both methods return the number of affected rows.

```php
// update the user with user_id 4
$newData = ['fname' => 'Raymond', 'lname' => 'Boyce'];
$db->updateRows('Users', $newData, ['user_id' => 4]);

// delete users with IDs 1, 2, and 3
$userTable->deleteFrom('Users', ['user_id' => [1, 2, 3]]);
```

### Transactions

Call the `begin()` method to start a transaction. `prepare()`, `execute()`, `query()`
and any of the shorthand methods can then be called as needed, before committing
or rolling back the transaction with `commit()` or `rollback()`.

### Binary columns

In order to insert/update raw binary data (e.g. to a binary, varbinary, or bytea column),
the bound parameter must have its encoding type set to binary. PeachySQL provides a
`makeBinaryParam()` method to simplify this:

```php
$db->insertRow('Users', [
    'fname' => 'Tony',
    'lname' => 'Hoare',
    'uuid' => $db->makeBinaryParam(Uuid::uuid4()->getBytes()),
]);
```
