- Unnecessary `$maximum` parameter from `Selector::offset` method.
- All previously-deprecated methods and options.

## [5.5.1] Differentiated Bit - 2017-11-09
### Added
- Support for using `makeBinaryParam` with nullable columns (issue [#5]).

## [5.5.0] Null Appreciation - 2017-10-19
### Added
- New `nu` and `nn` shorthand operators to filter where a column is or
is not null.

### Deprecated
- Ability to use null values with `eq` and `ne` operators.

## [5.4.0] Boolean Affectation - 2017-03-08
### Added
- `makeBinaryParam` method.

### Fixed
- `Statement::getAffected` method now consistently returns -1 when no
affected count is available.
- "Incorrect integer value" MySQL error when binding a false value.

## [5.3.1] Deprecation Proclamation - 2017-01-31
### Changed
- Updated readme to document `offset` method instead of deprecated
`paginate` method.

### Deprecated
- Unnecessary option getter/setter methods (`setTable`, `getTable`,
`setAutoIncrementValue`, `getAutoIncrementValue`, `setIdColumn`,
`getIdColumn`).

## [5.3.0] Descending Increase - 2016-11-04
### Added
- `Selector::offset` method to enable setting an offset that isn't a
multiple of the page size.

### Deprecated
- `Selector::paginate` method.

## [5.2.3] Protracted Refinement - 2016-08-28
### Added
- Support for generating filters with IS NOT NULL and multiple LIKE
operators.

## [5.2.2] Chainable Reparation - 2016-08-25
### Changed
- Updated dependencies and removed unused code.

### Fixed
- Return type of `Selector` functions to support subclass autocompletion.

## [5.2.1] Simple Safety - 2016-07-21
### Changed
- An exception is now thrown when attempting to use pagination without
sorting rows.
- Qualified column identifiers are now automatically escaped. As a
consequence, column names containing periods are no longer supported.

## [5.2.0] Intermediate Injection - 2016-07-07
### Added
- `selectFrom`, `insertRow`, `insertRows`, `updateRows`, and `deleteFrom`
methods which can be passed a table name rather than depending on options
passed to the PeachySQL constructor. This simplifies dependency injection
and also removes the need for implementation-specific options. The new
`selectFrom` method also supports pagination and more complex
sorting/filtering.

### Deprecated
- Old shorthand methods (`select`, `insertBulk`, `insertOne`, `update`,
and `delete`)

## [5.1.0] Futuristic Resourcefulness - 2016-04-15
### Changed
- `InsertResult::getId()` now throws an exception if no ID is available.
- Minor code cleanup.

### Fixed
- Compatibility issue with PHP 7 SQL Server driver (see
[Microsoft/msphpsql#84](https://github.com/Microsoft/msphpsql/issues/84)).

### Removed
- HHVM generator compatibility hack (no longer necessary as of HHVM v3.11).

## [5.0.0] Escaping Execution - 2015-09-16
### Added
- `prepare` method which binds parameters and returns a `Statement`
object. This object has an `execute` method which makes it possible
to run the prepared query multiple times with different values.

### Changed
- Column names are now automatically escaped, so shorthand methods can
be used without having to specify a list of valid columns.
- Rather than passing options to the PeachySQL constructor as an
associative array, an `Options` subclass should be passed instead.
This object has setters and getters for each setting, which improves
discoverability and refactoring.

### Removed
- `setConnection` and `setOptions` methods. Options can still be
dynamically changed by calling `getOptions()->setterMethod()`.

### Fixed
- Bug where MySQL insert IDs weren't calculated correctly if the
increment value was altered.

## [4.0.2] Preparatory Fixture - 2015-05-11
### Fixed
- Missing error info for MySQL prepared statement failures (issue [#4]).

### Removed
- Unnecessary `SqlResult::getQuery` method.

## [4.0.1] Stalwart Sparkle - 2015-02-08
### Changed
- Unused code cleanup
- Documentation improvements

## [4.0.0] Economical Alternator - 2015-02-06
### Added
- `SqlResult::getIterator` method which returns a `Generator`, making
it possible to iterate over very large result sets without running into
memory limitations.
- Optional third parameter on `select` method which accepts an array of
column names to sort by in ascending order.
- `SqlException::getSqlState` method which returns the standard SQLSTATE
code for the failure.

### Changed
- `SqlException::getMessage` now includes the SQL error message for the
failed query.
- `SqlException::getCode` now returns the MySQL or SQL Server error code.

### Removed
- PHP 5.4 support (5.5+ is now required - recent versions of HHVM should
also work if using MySQL).
- Deprecated `insert` and `insertAssoc` methods.
- Deprecated `TSQL` class.
- Ability to call `SqlResult::getFirst` and `SqlResult::getAll` multiple
times for a given result (since rows are no longer cached in the object).

## [3.0.1] Uniform Optimization - 2014-12-06
### Changed
- Improved documentation consistency
- Minor code cleanup and performance tweaks

## [3.0.0] Hyperactive Lightyear - 2014-12-02
### Added
- `insertOne` and `insertBulk` methods, which accept an associative array
of columns/values and return `InsertResult` and `BulkInsertResult` objects,
respectively.
- It is now possible to bulk-insert an arbitrarily large set of rows.
PeachySQL will automatically batch large inserts to remove limitations
on the maximum number of bound parameters and rows per query.

### Changed

The following classes have been renamed to improve API consistency:
- `PeachySQL` is now `PeachySql`
- `MySQL` is now `Mysql`
- `SQLException` is now `SqlException`
- `SQLResult` is now `SqlResult`
- `MySQLResult` is now `MysqlResult`

Since class and function names in PHP are case insensitive (as are file
names on some platforms), these renames do not necessarily break
backwards compatibility. However, existing references should still be
updated to avoid confusion.

### Deprecated
- `insertAssoc` method - use `insertOne` instead.
- `insert` method - use `insertBulk` instead.
- `TSQL` class - use `SqlServer` instead.

### Removed
- Previously deprecated `SqlResult::getRows` method.
- Optional callback parameters from `query` and shorthand methods.

## [2.1.0] Progressive Substitution - 2014-08-03
### Added
- `SQLResult::getFirst` method for retrieving the first selected row.
- `SQLResult::getAll` method for retrieving all selected rows.

### Deprecated
- `SQLResult::getRows` is now a deprecated alias of `SQLResult::getAll`.

## [2.0.0] Peachy Sequel - 2014-07-29
### Added
- `begin`, `commit`, and `rollback` methods to support transactions.
- `insertAssoc` method to easily insert a single row from an associative array.
- `setConnection` method to change the database connection after instantiation.
- Option to override the default auto increment value for MySQL.
- Custom `PeachySQL\SQLException` thrown for query errors, with methods
to retrieve the error array, SQL query string, and bound parameters.
- Contributing instructions.

### Changed
- The library is now namespaced under `PeachySQL`.
- Callbacks for shorthand methods are now optional. If no callback is
specified, the methods will return sensible defaults (e.g. `select`
returns selected rows, `insert` returns insert IDs, and `update` and
`delete` return the number of affected rows).
- A list of valid columns must now be passed to the options array to
generate queries which reference a column. This allows queries to be
generated from user data without the potential for SQL injection attacks.
- Callbacks are now passed a `SQLResult` object, rather than separate
arguments for selected and affected rows.
- Table name and identity column options are now passed to the
constructor as an associative array.
- If a flat array of values is passed to `insert`, the insert ID will
now be returned as an integer instead of an array.
- Updated code to follow the PSR-2 [coding style guide](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/).

### Removed
- `$dbType` argument from constructor (use `new PeachySQL\MySQL($conn)`
or `new PeachySQL\TSQL($conn)` instead).
- `getTableName` and `setTableName` methods (replaced with `getOptions`
and `setOptions`).
- `$idCol` parameter from `insert` method (specify via options array
instead if using SQL Server). 
- `splitRows` method (not core to PeachySQL's goal). The same functionality is
available in the [ArrayUtils library](https://github.com/theodorejb/array-utils).

## Fixed
- Potential error when inserting into a MySQL table without an
auto-incremented column.
- Errors are now thrown if required table/column names aren't specified.

## [1.1.1] - 2014-04-20
### Fixed
- Bug where additional (non-existent) insert IDs were returned when
inserting a single row into a MySQL table with a flat array.

### Removed
- Unnecessary usage of variable variables.

## [1.1.0] - 2014-04-11
### Changed
- The `query`, `select`, `insert`, `update`, and `delete` methods now
return the value of their callback function, making it easier to use
data outside the callback.
- A flat array of values can now be passed to the `insert` method to
insert a single row.

## [1.0.1] - 2014-03-28
### Changed
- Simplified `splitRows` example in readme.
- Short array syntax is now used consistently.
- Minor unit test improvements.

## [1.0.0] - 2014-02-20
